\## \*\*Getting Started\*\*

To set up a local copy for development or testing, follow these instructions.

\### \*\*Prerequisites\*\*

\- \*\*Node.js\*\* (>= version 14)

\- \*\*MongoDB\*\* (local or cloud-based)

\- \*\*npm\*\* or \*\*yarn\*\* as a package manager

\### \*\*Installation\*\*

1\. \*\*Clone the Repository\*\*

`   ````bash

`   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

`   `cd project-name

2. **Install Dependencies** bash Copy code   npm install
  
2. **Setup Database** Ensure MongoDB is running locally or have the URI for your MongoDB cloud setup.

**Configuration**

1. **Environment Variables** Create a .env file in the root directory with the following values: plaintext Copy code   MONGODB\_URL=your\_mongodb\_url
1. JWT\_SECRET=your\_jwt\_secret
1. PORT=your\_server\_port
  
1. **Run the App** bash Copy code   npm start
1. `   `The app will run at http://localhost:PORT as specified in your .env.

**Usage**

- **Sign up and Login** Create an account or login to access the main features.
- **Post Content** Add, edit, or delete posts with an intuitive user interface.
- **Comment and Interact** Users can leave comments on any post and engage with other users' content.
- **Admin Access** Access admin controls for user and content management.

**API Documentation**

The backend is structured around a RESTful API with the following key endpoints:

|**HTTP Method**|**Endpoint**|**Description**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|POST|/api/users/register|Register a new user|
|POST|/api/users/login|Authenticate a user|

|DELETE|/api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId|Delete a comment|

*Visit docs/api.md for a full breakdown of all endpoints.*

**Testing**

Run tests to verify that everything is working as expected. Testing covers both unit tests for core logic and integration tests for API endpoints.

1. **Run Tests** bash Copy code   npm test
  
1. **Run Coverage** bash Copy code   npm run coverage
  

**Roadmap**

Planned features and improvements include:

- Real-time notifications for user interactions
- Enhanced comment threading for better user engagement
- Implement post-liking feature for additional user interaction
- Option for post archiving by users
